Committers who commit more compute, stake larger amounts of tokens, and choose longer cooldown periods earn proportionally greater rewards - but they also face greater slashing penalties if they fail to maintain their committed compute levels. For example, committing 80% of your measured compute yields more rewards than committing 50%, but falling short on that 80% commitment results in larger slashing penalties. Delegators face a similar tradeoff: they can earn staking rewards without running hardware, but they share in their chosen committer's slashing risk. The key is finding the right balance - commit what you can reliably maintain over the long term. Conservative commitments (lower compute percentage, shorter cooldown) offer lower rewards but also lower risk, while aggressive commitments maximize rewards but require consistent, reliable operation of your hardware."),(0,r.yg)("h2",{id:"getting-started-with-staking"},"Getting Started with Staking"),(0,r.yg)("h3",{id:"why-do-i-only-see-one-slider-to-commit-compute-when-the-four-metrics-are-treated-separately-anyway"},"Why do I only see one slider to Commit Compute, when the four metrics are treated separately anyway?"),(0,r.yg)("p",null,"Even though any stake is basically a separate committement for each of the four of the benchmark pools (CPUs, CPUm, RAM, Storage), the staking frontend only shows one slider for simplicity reasons.
