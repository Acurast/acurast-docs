Some entities and individuals have received ACU tokens that are vested for a certain period of time, as outlined in the [token allocations](/tokenomics#token-allocations). Vested tokens originate from early funding rounds, team allocations, and airdrops. As time passes, the owners can claim the released tokens.

To claim the released tokens, follow these steps:

1. Log in to [hub.acurast.com](https://hub.acurast.com) using the account that owns the vested tokens.
2. Go to the **Balances** tab.
3. Next to the vested balance, a claim button should be visible and the amount of claimable tokens will be displayed.
4. Click **"Claim"** and sign the transaction when prompted in your wallet.
