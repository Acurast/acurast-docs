The Acurast Orchestrator is a centerpiece of the consensus layer, combining the orchestration (i.e., the scheduling of deployments and enabling the liquid matching) of the Processor’s computational resources and Developers. The orchestrator plays an essential role in the definition, agreement, and enforcement of value exchange between processors and developers.

The orchestrator is where the liquid matching engine pairs the advertised processor resources with the defined requirements of the developers. The orchestrator natively supports various price-finding mechanisms (e.g., auctions and advertisements), making Developer Experience (DevEx) highly accessible and seamless.

Every agreement between processor and developer is specified in an entity called deployment. The deployment specifies (i) a set of instructions that are executed on the processor, (ii) its scheduling parameters, and (iii) the destination configuration (i.e., where the output is further processed or persisted).

## Compute Costs & Rewards

When scheduling a deployment, the developer defines the compute cost for the execution. The cost can be defined in native cACU/ACU tokens. This mechanism allows for deterministic financial planning of executions for developers.

**All compute costs are paid as gas (transaction) fees. There is no direct reward flow from developers to processors.**

:::

Instead, processors earn rewards through the **[staking pools](/staked-compute/overview)**. When processors execute deployments, they receive a [Deployment Execution Bonus](/processors/rewards#deployment-execution-bonus): a bonus weight on their Benchmark Metrics that increases their scoring—and therefore their share of rewards—in both the Staked Compute Pool and the Compute Pool (Base Benchmarking Rewards) for that epoch. This mechanism ensures processors are incentivized to execute deployments and burn gas fees.
