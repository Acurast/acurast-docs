# How To Get Started

Developers can already use Acurast today to build their Web3 applications enabled by off-chain data and computation from Acurast.

## Phase 0

_Phase 0 is an interim phase, until the Acurast Protocol and the Acurast Marketplace are live which is targeted for Q1 2023. This approach already enables developers to use the Acurast Trusted Virtual Machine of the Acurast Transmitters._

1. Create a Script for your use case, take a look at the [Examples](introduction#examples/)
2. Run your Script in the [Playground](/playground/) to verify
3. [Reach out](https://acurast.com#contact) to us and provide us your Script and your required destination network e.g. Polkadot:Moonbeam
4. We'll match you with Data Transmitter and have them run your Script
5. Your output will be pushed to your destination by the Data Transmitters and you can start using it in your Web3 application

## Phase 1

_With the launch of the Acurast Protocol and the Acurast Marketplace_

1. Create a Script for your use case, take a look at the [Examples](introduction#examples/)
2. Run your Script in the [Playground](/playground/) to verify
3. Create an Acurast Job on the Marketplace with your Script, Service Level Agreement and reward as well as other parameters
4. The Marketplace matches you with Acurast Transmitters
5. Your output will be pushed to your destination by the Data Transmitters and you can start using it in your Web3 application
