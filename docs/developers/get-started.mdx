# Developers

Developers or Developers are the ones that are in need of computation for their applications. Developers can define in accessible Javascript code their requirements and get access to computational resources through the Acurast Marketplace by being matched with Processors.

The so-called Acurast Deployments are executed by Processors in their Trusted Execution Environment that provide the Output of the Deployment and a Proof of Execution to the defined destination chain.

**Developers define their requirements in code.**

## Get Started

Head to [Integration Levels â†—](/integrations/introduction) for more details:

### Level 2

1. Go to the [Acurast Console](https://console.acurast.com/) and log in with a supported wallet of your Ecosystem e.g., Metamask for Ethereum
1. Fund Account - Get Acurast Canary (cACU) asset for your account, to be able to create Deployments, with "Fund Account" or head directly to the [Faucet](https://faucet.acurast.com/).
1. Go to "Create Deployment" and select your destination, the ecosystem you're building in.
1. Select an existing template, adapt it or write your own code that fits your needs. Test your code with "Test Code".
1. Select "Public Processors"
   1. Alternatively select one or more of your "Personal Processors"
   1. or enter the address of one or more "Specific Processors"
1. Define your "Execution Schedule" with the parameters such as start and endtime, interval etc.
1. Specify "Additional Parameters"
   1. The number of Processors and their reputation
   1. The fulfillment fee, the transaction/gas fees for each submission
   1. The reward, paid in the native asset of your ecosystem e.g., ETH
1. Publish your Deployment, it will be matched, acknowledged and then wait for your first fulfillment.

1. Publish your Deployment, it will be matched, acknowledged
1. Head to the "Deployment Details", check the address of each Processor for your destination ecosystem.
   1. Send transaction/gas fees to your unique address, that the Processor is able to inject the signed output directly.
1. Wait for your first fulfillment
