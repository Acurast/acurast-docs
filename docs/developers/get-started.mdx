# Consumers

Consumers or Developers are the ones that are in need of computation for their applications. Consumers can define in accessible Javascript code their requirements and get access to computational resources through the Acurast Marketplace by being matched with Processors.

The so-called Acurast Jobs are executed by Processors in their Trusted Execution Environment that provide the Output of the Job and a Proof of Execution to the defined destination chain.

**Consumers define their requirements in code.**

## Get Started

Head to [Integration Levels â†—](/integrations/introduction) for more details:

### Level 2

1. Go to the [Acurast Console](https://console.acurast.com/) and log in with a supported wallet of your Ecosystem e.g., Metamask for Ethereum
1. Fund Account - Get Acurast Canary (cACU) asset for your account, to be able to create Jobs, with "Fund Account" or head directly to the [Faucet](https://faucet.acurast.com/).
1. Go to "Create Job" and select your destination, the ecosystem you're building in.
1. Select an existing template, adapt it or write your own code that fits your needs. Test your code with "Test Code".
1. Select "Public Processors"
   1. Alternatively select one or more of your "Personal Processors"
   1. or enter the address of one or more "Specific Processors"
1. Define your "Execution Schedule" with the parameters such as start and endtime, interval etc.
1. Specify "Additional Parameters"
   1. The number of Processors and their reputation
   1. The fulfillment fee, the transaction/gas fees for each submission
   1. The reward, paid in the native asset of your ecosystem e.g., ETH
1. Publish your Job, it will be matched, acknowledged and then wait for your first fulfillment.

   1. The number of Processors and their reputation
   1. The reward, paid in the native asset of your ecosystem e.g., ETH
1. Publish your Job, it will be matched, acknowledged
1. Head to the "Job Details", check the address of each Processor for your destination ecosystem.
   1. Send transaction/gas fees to your unique address, that the Processor is able to inject the signed output directly.
1. Wait for your first fulfillment

Not sure if your ecosystem is supported? Take a look at [Ecosystems & Integrations](/integrations/introduction).

## Examples

Code examples for the [Acurast Enterprise](/acurast-protocol/modules/enterprise) module for off-chain data and computation.

### HTTPS GET Request

Request from an API with the result of an asset price.

<RunnableCode>

```ts
httpGET(
  "https://api.binance.com/api/v3/ticker/price?symbol=BNBBTC",
  {},
  (response, certificate) => {
    console.log("response", response);
    const price = JSON.parse(response)["price"] * 10 ** 6;
    console.log("price", price);
    const payload = { price: price, timestamp: Date.now() / 1000 };
    const packedPayload = pack(payload);
    const signature = sign(payload);
    httpPOST(
      "https://oracle.free.beeceptor.com",
      JSON.stringify({
        signature: signature,
        certificate: certificate,
        payload: packedPayload,
      }),
      {},
      (response, certificate) => {},
      (errorMessage) => {}
    );
  },
  (errorMessage) => {}
);
```

</RunnableCode>

### Verifiable Randomness

Getting a randomized output from the Trusted Execution Environment.

<RunnableCode>

```ts
return fulfill(generateSecureRandomHex());
```

</RunnableCode>
