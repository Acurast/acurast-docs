On demand deployments are special kind of deployments that can be used to access a processor on demand from a dapp. This is achieved by having the deployment open a websocket connection to the acurast websocket service and setup handlers to process incoming messages.

### On Demand deployment script

The snippet below shows a very simple on demand deployment script that setups a websocket connection to the acurast websocket service and registers a payload handler that just sends back the message it receives.

```javascript
_STD_.ws.open(
  // open a websocket connection to the provided server
  ["wss://ws-1.ws-server-1.acurast.com", "wss://ws-1.ws-server-2.acurast.com "],
  () => {
    print("open: success");
    _STD_.ws.registerPayloadHandler((payload) => {
      // register a handler for incoming messages
      _STD_.ws.send(payload.sender, payload.payload); // just send back the received message
    });
  },
  (err) => {
    print("open: error " + err);
  }
);
```

An on demand deployment should be scheduled with a long duration since the deployment needs to continuously run in order to be able to process incoming messages.

### dApp integration

A dApp can start interacting with a running on demand deployment by integrating the [Acurast Typescript SDK](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-typescript-sdk). See the example dapp for on how a simple integration works.

### Acurast websocket service

The Acurast websocket service is a P2P service that allows to simply send messages to clients connected to it. Clients are authenticated during the initial connection setup by signing a challenge with their private key (in case of a processor, that would be the private key specifically generated for the deployment creator).

The initial connection setup and authentication flow is as follows:

- Client sends an `init` message to the websocket service.
- Websocket service responds with a `challenge` message, providing the bytes to be signed.
- Client creates the payload to sign by concatenating the `challenge` bytes, the client public key and a 16 bytes nonce.
- Client signs the payload and responds to the challenge by sending beck the signature alongside the originally received challenge bytes, client public key and nonce.
- Websocket service verifies the signature and if it is valid accepts the connection.

After a client is authenticated, it can be addressed by specifying its public key as the recipient.
