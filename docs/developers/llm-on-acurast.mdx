## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of deploying and running an LLM on Acurast.

Acurast includes a module for running LLMs. Most models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) in the `GGUF` format are supported.

:::tip

If you prefer to jump right in, you can take a look at our example project:

- [LLMs on Acurast](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-example-apps/tree/main/apps/app-llm)

You can either clone the repository, or set up a blank Acurast starter project by running `npx @acurast/cli new <project-name>`.

:::

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Node.js and the Command Line

## Setting up the Project

### Project Structure

The structure of a project looks exactly like a normal Node.js project:

```
├── dist
│   └── bundle.js
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── acurast.json
├── package-lock.json
├── package.json
├── src
│   └── index.ts
├── .env
├── tsconfig.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

There is only one file that is specific to Acurast, which is `acurast.json`. This file is used to configure the deployment, and we will come back to it later in the tutorial.

### Writing the code

First, let's start by creating a simple node.js project. You can find the code of the example, including all the build steps and configurations, on [GitHub](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-example-apps/tree/main/apps/app-llm)

The app will host a local LLM server and make it available over HTTP.

```typescript
import path from "path";
import {
  MODEL_URL,
  MODEL_NAME,
  STORAGE_DIR,
  LOCALTUNNEL_HOST,
} from "./constants";
import { createWriteStream, existsSync } from "fs";
import { Readable } from "stream";
import { finished } from "stream/promises";
import localtunnel from "localtunnel";

declare let _STD_: any;

const MODEL_FILE = path.resolve(STORAGE_DIR, MODEL_NAME);
async function downloadModel(url: string, dst: string) {
  console.log("Downloading model", MODEL_NAME);
  const res = await fetch(url);

  if (!res.body) {
    throw new Error("No response body");
  }

  console.log("Writing model to file:", dst);
  const writer = createWriteStream(dst);
  await finished(Readable.fromWeb(res.body as any).pipe(writer));
}
async function main() {
  if (!existsSync(MODEL_FILE)) {
    await downloadModel(MODEL_URL, MODEL_FILE);
  } else {
    console.log("Using already downloaded model:", MODEL_FILE);
  }
  console.log("model downloaded");

  _STD_.llama.server.start(
    ["--model", MODEL_FILE, "--ctx-size", "2048", "--threads", "8"],
    () => {
      // onCompletion
      console.log("Llama server closed.");
    },
    (error: any) => {
      // onError
      console.log("Llama server error:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  );
  const tunnel = await localtunnel({
    port: 8080,
    host: LOCALTUNNEL_HOST,
    subdomain: _STD_.device.getAddress().toLowerCase(),
  });

  console.log(tunnel.url);
}

main();
```

In this code, we first download a model from Hugging Face, then start the integrated LLM server and load it. Finally, we use localtunnel to make the server publicly available.

:::tip

The API is compatible with the [OpenAI-like API endpoints](https://lmstudio.ai/docs/basics/server#openai-like-api-endpoints)

:::

We need to set the `LOCALTUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` variable to specifiy where our server will be available. If we set it to `llm`, then the URL will be `https://llm.acu.run`.

:::note

This localtunnel server is not secure and should not be used in production. We are working on making this secure by default, but if you need a secure way to host your project now, please reach out to us.

### Building the project

To deploy a project to the Acurast Cloud, it needs to be bundled into a single js file. In our example, we use webpack. You can find the configuration in the example project on [GitHub](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-example-apps/blob/main/apps/app-llm/)

Running `npm run bundle` will then output a single js file which includes all necessary dependencies.

The file is located in `dist/bundle.js`. It includes your code, as well as all the dependencies in a single file.

This is the file that will be deployed to the Acurast Cloud.

## Setting up the Acurast CLI

Now that our app is ready, we need to set up the Acurast CLI. The CLI is a tool that allows you to deploy and manage your applications on the Acurast Cloud.

### Installation

Let's install the Acurast CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @acurast/cli
```

To verify that the installation worked, you can run `acurast` in the terminal and it will show you the help page:

```text
tutorial % acurast
     _                            _      ____ _     ___
    / \   ___ _   _ _ __ __ _ ___| |_   / ___| |   |_ _|
   / _ \ / __| | | | '__/ _` / __| __| | |   | |    | |
  / ___ \ (__| |_| | | | (_| \__ \ |_  | |___| |___ | |
 /_/   \_\___|\__,_|_|  \__,_|___/\__|  \____|_____|___|

Usage: acurast [options] [command]

A cli to interact with the Acurast Network.

Options:
  -v, --version               output the version number
  -h, --help                  display help for command

Commands:
  deploy [options] [project]  Deploy the current project to the Acurast platform.
  init                        Create an acurast.json and .env file
  live [options] [project]    Run the code in a live code environment on a remote processor
  open                        Open Acurast websites in your browser
  help [command]              display help for command
```

### Adding Acurast Config to the Project

The next step is to add the Acurast Config to our project. To do that, run the following command:

```bash
acurast init
```

This will start an interactive guide, which will create an `.env` file.

If you checked out the sample project, the `acurast.json` already exists, so this step will be skipped. You can open the `acurast.json` file and change the configuration there. In the [CLI Docs](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-details) you will find more information about the possible configurations.

### Getting ready for Deployment

To deploy our application, we still need to do one thing. Getting some tokens from the faucet.

> [!TIP]
> You can import the mnemonic that was generated and stored in the .env file and import it in Talisman (Browser Extension) to access the same account in the [Web Console](https://hub.acurast.com/).

Let's get some tokens on your new account. You can run the `acurast deploy` command, which will check your balance, and displays the link to the Faucet page.

```text
tutorial % acurast deploy --dry-run

Deploying project "app-llm"

Your balance is 0. Visit https://faucet.acurast.com?address=5GNimXAQhayQq8m8SxJt3xQmG2L3pGzeTkHopx9iPnrS6uHP to get some tokens.
```

Visit the link displayed in the CLI and follow the instructions to get some tokens. They should be available in a few seconds.

That's it! You're now ready to deploy your app.

## Deploying the Application

To deploy your application, run `acurast deploy`:

```text
tutorial % acurast deploy

Deploying project "tutorial"

The CLI will use the following address: 5GNimXAQhayQq8m8SxJt3xQmG2L3pGzeTkHopx9iPnrS6uHP

The deployment will be scheduled to start in 5 minutes 0 seconds.

There will be 1 executions with a cost of 0.001 cACU each.

❯ Deploying project (first execution scheduled in 246s)
  ✔ Submitted to Acurast (ipfs://...)
  ✔ Deployment registered (DeploymentID: ...)
  ⠇ Waiting for deployment to be matched with processors
  ◼ Waiting for processor acknowledgements
```

Congratulations, your deployment is now being registered in the network and executed soon! Check the CLI for more information about the deployment process.

## Verifying the Deployment

If you followed this tutorial, then your app will be available at `https://<your-subdomain>.acu.run`. ("\<your-subdomain\>" is the value you set for `LOCALTUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` in the code).

Success! You've successfully deployed your first application on Acurast!

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed your first application on Acurast!
