:::caution Ledger Support Not Yet Available

Ledger hardware wallets **cannot currently be used to sign Acurast transactions**. While it is possible to derive an Acurast address using a Ledger device, transaction signing is not yet supported. This means you cannot send tokens, stake, or interact with the Acurast network using a Ledger.

Full Ledger support is being worked on and will be announced once available.

:::

## Current Limitations

- **Transaction signing is not supported** — You cannot approve or submit any on-chain transactions (transfers, staking, etc.) using a Ledger device on Acurast.
- **Message signing only** — Ledger can currently only be used to sign messages, not transactions.
- **Do not transfer funds** to a Ledger-derived Acurast address until full transaction signing support is confirmed, as you will not be able to move them.

## What to Use Instead

In the meantime, you can use one of the following supported wallets to interact with Acurast:

- [SubWallet](/wallets/wallets-subwallet)
- [Talisman](/wallets/wallets-talisman)
- [AirGap](/wallets/wallets-airgap)
