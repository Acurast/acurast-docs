### Create an Acurast address with Ledger

This guide explains how to create an address with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet. Ledger provides secure cold storage for your crypto assets by keeping your private keys offline.

:::info

Acurast is built on Polkadot technology, so you'll need to install the Polkadot app on your Ledger device to manage Acurast accounts.

This guide uses **Polkadot.js extension** as the wallet interface, but your Ledger hardware wallet can also be used with other Polkadot-compatible wallets such as [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/) or [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/).

   - Transaction type
   - Amount (if applicable)

### Troubleshooting

**Ledger not detected:**
- Make sure your Ledger device is unlocked and the Polkadot app is open
- Try a different USB cable or port
- Ensure Ledger Live is closed (it can interfere with browser access)
- Enable "Blind signing" in the Polkadot app settings on your Ledger if required

**Transaction fails:**
- Verify you have sufficient token balance for transaction fees (cACU for Canary or ACU for Mainnet)
- Make sure your Ledger firmware is up to date
- Check that the Polkadot app on your Ledger is the latest version
