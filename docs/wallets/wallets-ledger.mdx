### Create an Acurast address with Ledger

This guide explains how to create an address with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet. Ledger provides secure cold storage for your crypto assets by keeping your private keys offline.

:::info

Acurast is built on Polkadot technology, so you'll need to install the Polkadot app on your Ledger device to manage Acurast accounts.

This guide uses **Polkadot.js extension** as the wallet interface, but your Ledger hardware wallet can also be used with other Polkadot-compatible wallets such as [SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/) or [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/).

  }}
/>

<ThemedImage
  sources={{

### Signing Transactions with Ledger

When you make a transaction on the Acurast Hub:

1. Your Ledger device will prompt you to review the transaction details
2. **Carefully verify** the transaction information on your Ledger screen:
   - Transaction type
   - Amount (if applicable)
   - Destination address
   - Fees
3. Use the buttons on your Ledger to navigate through the transaction details
4. If everything is correct, approve the transaction on your Ledger device
5. The transaction will be broadcast to the Acurast network

### Troubleshooting

**Ledger not detected:**
- Make sure your Ledger device is unlocked and the Polkadot app is open
- Try a different USB cable or port
- Ensure Ledger Live is closed (it can interfere with browser access)
- Enable "Blind signing" in the Polkadot app settings on your Ledger if required

**Transaction fails:**
- Verify you have sufficient token balance for transaction fees (cACU for Canary or ACU for Mainnet)
- Make sure your Ledger firmware is up to date
- Check that the Polkadot app on your Ledger is the latest version
