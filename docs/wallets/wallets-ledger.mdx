### Create an Acurast address with Ledger (and SubWallet)

This guide explains how to create an address with [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) hardware wallet. Ledger provides secure cold storage for your crypto assets by keeping your private keys offline.

:::info

Acurast is built on Polkadot technology, so you'll need to install the Polkadot app on your Ledger device to manage Acurast accounts.

This guide is written for **Ledger hardware wallets** with the **SubWallet** extension in a **Chromium based browser**. Talisman, Polkadot.js and Firefox do not fully support this setup at this point in time.
