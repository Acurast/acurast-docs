## Integrations

Support for Acurast in a Web3 ecosystem can be achieved through various integration approaches:

### Substrate

Acurast supports with its Pallet the integration on a Substrate level, enabling Substrate-based chains to receive the output from Acurast Jobs.

Learn about an integration with [Substrate](/integrations/substrate/)

### Substrate with WASM

Acurast supports with its integration of the Pallet the routing to WASM based environment, making the output consumable on a Substrate chain with a WASM environment.

Learn about an integration with [Substrate with WASM](/integrations/substrate-wasm/)

### Tezos

Acurast supports Tezos smart contracts as the destination of outputs from Acurast Processors directly as the required secp256r1 is supported natively by Tezos.

Learn about Acurast on [Tezos](/integrations/tezos/)

### EVM

Acurast can be used to get access to computational resources for various use cases and bring them to EVM chains.

### Upcoming Integrations

More details will be available soon about the upcoming integrations, these include the following ecosystems:

- Cosmos
- NEAR
- Additional EVM Chains
