# Substrate Integration

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core)

The Acurast Pallet allows a Substrate based chain to integrate the Acurast functionality to be able to securly receive real world data posted by the Acurast Transmitters.

## Extrinsics

The Pallet exposes a number of extrinsic.

#### register

Allows the registration of a job. A registration consists of:

- An ipfs URL to a `script` (written in Javascript).
  - The script will be run in the Acurast Trusted Virtual Machine that uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on the Acurast Data Transmitter.
- An optional `allowedSources` list of allowed sources.
  - A list of `AccountId`s that are allowed to `fulfill` the job. If no list is provided, all sources are accepted.
- An `allowOnlyVerifiedSources` boolean indicating if only verified source can fulfill the job.
  - A verified source is one that has provided a valid key attestation.
- An `extra` structure that can be used to provide custom parameters.

Registrations are saved per `AccountId` and `script`, meaning that `register` is called twice from the same `AccountId` with the same `script` value, the previous registration is overwritten.

### deregister

Allows the de-registration of a job.

### updateAllowedSources

Allows to update the list of allowed sources for a previously registered job.

### updateJobAssignments

Allows to assign a registered job to a processor, so that it can later call `fulfill`.

### fulfill

Allows to post the fulfillment of a registered job. The `fulfill` call will fail if the job was not previously assigned to the origin. The fulfillment structure consists of:

- The ipfs url of the `script` executed.
- The `payload` bytes representing the output of the `script`.

In addition to the `fulfillment` structure, `fulfill` expects the `AccountId` of the `requester` of the job.

### submitAttestation

Allows an Acurast Data Transmitter to submit a key attestation proving its integrity. The extrinsic parameter is a valid attestation certificate chain.

### updateCertificateRevocationList

Allows to update the certificate recovation list used during attestation validation.

## Setup

Add the following dependency to your Cargo manifest:

```toml
[dependencies]
pallet-acurast = { git = "https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core.git" }
```

## Parachain Integration

Implement `pallet_acurast::Config` for your `Runtime` and add the Pallet:

```rust
#[derive(RuntimeDebug, Encode, Decode, MaxEncodedLen, TypeInfo, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct AcurastRegistrationExtra {
	/// my extra registration parameters
}

/// My fulfillment router
pub struct AcurastRouter;
impl pallet_acurast::FulfillmentRouter<Runtime> for AcurastRouter {
	fn received_fulfillment(
		origin: frame_system::pallet_prelude::OriginFor<Runtime>,
		from: <Runtime as frame_system::Config>::AccountId,
		fulfillment: pallet_acurast::Fulfillment,
		registration: pallet_acurast::JobRegistrationFor<Runtime>,
		requester: <<Runtime as frame_system::Config>::Lookup as StaticLookup>::Target,
	) -> DispatchResultWithPostInfo {
		/// route the fulfillment to its final destination
	}
}

parameter_types! {
    pub const MaxAllowedSources: u16 = 100;
	pub const AcurastPalletId: PalletId = PalletId(*b"acrstpid");
}

impl pallet_acurast::Config for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type RegistrationExtra = AcurastRegistrationExtra;
	type FulfillmentRouter = AcurastRouter;
	type MaxAllowedSources = MaxAllowedSources;
	type RewardManager = (); // provide proper type to enable rewards to be payed on fulfillment
	type PalletId = AcurastPalletId;
	type RevocationListUpdateBarrier = ();
	type JobAssignmentUpdateBarrier = ();
	type UnixTime = pallet_timestamp::Pallet<Self>;
	type WeightInfo = pallet_acurast::weights::WeightInfo<Self>;
}

// Create the runtime by composing the FRAME pallets that were previously configured.
construct_runtime!(
	pub enum Runtime where
		Block = Block,
		NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
		UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic,
	{
		// All your other pallets
        ...
		// Acurast
		Acurast: pallet_acurast::{Pallet, Call, Storage, Event<T>} = 50,
	}
);
```

## P256 signatures

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/tree/main/p256-crypto)

Acurast Data Transmitter will sign extrinsics (the `fulfill` call) using a P256 (a.k.a secp256r1) private key.

By default, Substrate does not support the P256 curve. Use the `acurast-p256-crypto` crate to add support for P256 signature verification.

To do so, use the `acurast_p256_crypto::MultiSignature` as your parachain `Signature` type:

```rust
use acurast_p256_crypto::MultiSignature;

pub type Signature = MultiSignature;
pub type AccountId = <<Signature as Verify>::Signer as IdentifyAccount>::AccountId;
...

impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
	type AccountId = AccountId;
    ...
}
```
