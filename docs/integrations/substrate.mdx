# Substrate Integration

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core)

The Acurast Receiver Pallet allows a Substrate based chain to integrate the Acurast functionality to be able to securely receive real world data posted by the Acurast Transmitters.

### Introduction

The Acurast Fulfillment Receiver Pallet, in combination with the [Acurast P256 crypto](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/tree/main/p256-crypto) package, allows a Parachain to accept direct fulfillments from Acurast Processors.

The Pallet exposes one extrinsic.

#### fulfill

Allows to post the [Fulfillment] of a job. The fulfillment structure consists of:

- The ipfs url of the `script` executed.
- The `payload` bytes representing the output of the `script`.

### Parachain Integration

Implement `pallet_acurast_fulfillment_receiver::Config` for your `Runtime` and add the Pallet:

```rust
frame_support::construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        Block = Block,
        NodeBlock = Block,
        UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic,
    {
        System: frame_system::{Pallet, Call, Config, Storage, Event<T>} = 0,
        AcurastFulfillmentReceiver: crate::{Pallet, Call, Event<T>}
    }
);

impl pallet_acurast_fulfillment_receiver::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
    type OnFulfillment = FulfillmentHandler;
    type WeightInfo = ();
}

pub struct FulfillmentHandler;
impl OnFulfillment<Runtime> for FulfillmentHandler {
    fn on_fulfillment(
        from: <Runtime as frame_system::Config>::AccountId,
        _fulfillment: pallet_acurast_fulfillment_receiver::Fulfillment,
    ) -> sp_runtime::DispatchResultWithInfo<frame_support::weights::PostDispatchInfo> {
        /// check if origin is a valid Acurast Processor AccountId
        if !is_valid(&from) {
            return Err(DispatchError::BadOrigin.into());
        }
        /// if valid, then fulfillment can be used
        Ok(().into())
    }
}
```

Provide and implementation of [OnFulfillment] to handle the received fulfillment. The implementation should check that the fulfillment is from a known Acurast Processor account id.

## P256 crypto

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/tree/main/p256-crypto)

This crate provides types that allow to add P256 (a.k.a secp256r1) signature verification support to substrate based chains.

### Setup

Add the following dependency to your Cargo manifest:

```toml
[dependencies]
acurast-p256-crypto = { git = "https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core.git" }
```

### Integration

Use the `acurast_p256_crypto::MultiSignature` as your parachain `Signature` type:

```rust
use acurast_p256_crypto::MultiSignature;

pub type Signature = MultiSignature;
pub type AccountId = <<Signature as Verify>::Signer as IdentifyAccount>::AccountId;
...

impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
	type AccountId = AccountId;
    ...
}
```

## Acurast Proxy Pallet

The Acurast Proxy Pallet is an additional feature and not needed to be implemented yet without the Acurast Marketplace being live on its own Parachain.

The Pallet is meant to be integrated by other parachains to interact with the Acurast parachain and the marketplace.

### Introduction

The Acurast Proxy pallet serves to call the extrinsics of the main pallet on the acurast parachain, from any other parachain.
It uses the XCMP protocol and XCM format for transmitting and interpreting messages.

#### register

Allows the registration of a job. A registration consists of:

- An ipfs URL to a `script` (written in Javascript).
  - The script will be run in the Acurast Trusted Virtual Machine that uses a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on the Acurast Data Transmitter.
- An optional `allowedSources` list of allowed sources.
  - A list of `AccountId`s that are allowed to `fulfill` the job. If no list is provided, all sources are accepted.
- An `allowOnlyVerifiedSources` boolean indicating if only verified source can fulfill the job.
  - A verified source is one that has provided a valid key attestation.
- An `extra` structure that can be used to provide custom parameters.

Registrations are saved per `AccountId` and `script`, meaning that `register` is called twice from the same `AccountId` with the same `script` value, the previous registration is overwritten.

#### deregister

Allows the de-registration of a job.

#### updateAllowedSources

Allows to update the list of allowed sources for a previously registered job.

#### fulfill

Allows to post the fulfillment of a registered job. The fulfillment structure consists of:

- The ipfs url of the `script` executed.
- The `payload` bytes representing the output of the `script`.

In addition to the `fulfillment` structure, `fulfill` expects the `AccountId` of the `requester` of the job.

### Setup

Add the following dependency to your Cargo manifest:

```toml
[dependencies]
acurast-proxy = { git = "https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core", default-features = false, branch = "feat/proxy-pallet" }
```

### Parachain Integration

To integrate the acurast proxy in a parachain, there is some runtime setup needed. First we need to add the pallet to
the [construct_runtime](https:://example.com) macro as following:

```rust
construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        Block = Block,
        NodeBlock = opaque::Block,
        UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic,
    {
        System: frame_system::{Pallet, Call, Config, Storage, Event<T>} = 0,

        ...

        AcurastProxy: acurast_proxy::{Pallet, Call, Event<T>} = 34,

    }
);
```

Then we have to add some parameter types to be used in the pallet config. Specifically the pallet id of the marketplace
pallet and the parachain id of acurast parachain. The parachain id is used to route correctly the xcm messages from cumulus
to acurast. The pallet id is needed to properly encode the call that we want to execute into the xcm message.

```rust
parameter_types! {
	pub const AcurastParachainId: u32 = 2000;
	pub const AcurastPalletId: u8 = 41;
}
```

the parachain id should be found in the chainspec of acurast, and the pallet id in the definition inside the construct_runtime macro
(e.g "ExamplePallet: pallet_example = 42" would mean the pallet id is 42)

Lastly we need to configure the pallet with the parameter types defined before, and some default values like Event and ().
The XcmRouter is defined in xcm_config, and we are also using the default one, but whoever integrates this pallet should
make sure that the router is able to send XCMP messages.

```rust
impl acurast_proxy::Config for Runtime {
	type Event = Event;
	type AcurastParachainId = AcurastParachainId;
	type AcurastPalletId = AcurastPalletId;
	type XcmSender = XcmRouter;
	type RegistrationExtra = JobRequirements<AcurastAsset>;
}
```
