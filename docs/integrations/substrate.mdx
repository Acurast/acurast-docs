# Substrate Integration

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core)

The Acurast Receiver Pallet allows a Substrate based chain to integrate the Acurast functionality to be able to securely receive real world data posted by the Acurast Processors.

### Introduction

The Acurast Fulfillment Receiver Pallet, in combination with the [Acurast P256 crypto](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/tree/main/p256-crypto) package, allows a Parachain to accept direct fulfillments from Acurast Processors.

The Pallet exposes one extrinsic.

#### fulfill

Allows to post the [Fulfillment] of a job. The fulfillment structure consists of:

- The ipfs url of the `script` executed.
- The `payload` bytes representing the output of the `script`.

### Parachain Integration

Implement `pallet_acurast_fulfillment_receiver::Config` for your `Runtime` and add the Pallet:

```rust
frame_support::construct_runtime!(
    pub enum Runtime where
        Block = Block,
        NodeBlock = Block,
        UncheckedExtrinsic = UncheckedExtrinsic,
    {
        System: frame_system::{Pallet, Call, Config, Storage, Event<T>} = 0,
        AcurastFulfillmentReceiver: crate::{Pallet, Call, Event<T>}
    }
);

impl pallet_acurast_fulfillment_receiver::Config for Runtime {
    type Event = Event;
    type OnFulfillment = FulfillmentHandler;
    type WeightInfo = ();
}

pub struct FulfillmentHandler;
impl OnFulfillment<Runtime> for FulfillmentHandler {
    fn on_fulfillment(
        from: <Runtime as frame_system::Config>::AccountId,
        _fulfillment: pallet_acurast_fulfillment_receiver::Fulfillment,
    ) -> sp_runtime::DispatchResultWithInfo<frame_support::weights::PostDispatchInfo> {
        /// check if origin is a valid Acurast Processor AccountId
        if !is_valid(&from) {
            return Err(DispatchError::BadOrigin.into());
        }
        /// if valid, then fulfillment can be used
        Ok(().into())
    }
}
```

Provide an implementation of [OnFulfillment] to handle the received fulfillment. The implementation should check that the fulfillment is from a known Acurast Processor account id.

## P256 crypto

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core/tree/main/p256-crypto)

This crate provides types that allow to add P256 (a.k.a secp256r1) signature verification support to substrate based chains.

### Setup

Add the following dependency to your Cargo manifest:

```toml
[dependencies]
acurast-p256-crypto = { git = "https://github.com/Acurast/acurast-core.git" }
```

### Integration

Use the `acurast_p256_crypto::MultiSignature` as your parachain `Signature` type:

```rust
use acurast_p256_crypto::MultiSignature;

pub type Signature = MultiSignature;
pub type AccountId = <<Signature as Verify>::Signer as IdentifyAccount>::AccountId;
...

impl frame_system::Config for Runtime {
	type AccountId = AccountId;
    ...
}
```
