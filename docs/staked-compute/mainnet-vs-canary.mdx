Acurast operates two networks - Mainnet and Canary - each with different staking reward structures and purposes.

## Staking on Acurast Canary Network

Canary serves as Acurast's testing and experimental network, where new features are deployed and tested before moving to Mainnet. Staking rewards on Canary are significantly smaller, with only 1% of epoch inflation allocated to the Staked Compute Pool, while 99% goes to benchmark rewards. This distribution prioritizes onboarding new devices and testing network behavior over long-term staking incentives.

## Staking on Acurast Mainnet

Mainnet is Acurast's production network with a mature reward structure designed for long-term sustainability. Here, 70% of epoch inflation goes to the Staked Compute Pool (staking rewards), while the remaining inflation is distributed to: 15% Treasury, 10% Benchmark rewards, and 5% Collators (block producers). This higher allocation to staked compute reflects Mainnet's focus on securing reliable, committed compute capacity.
