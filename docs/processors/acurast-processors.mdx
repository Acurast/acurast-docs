The Acurast processor is the app that is running on smartphones which take part in the Acurast Decentralized Compute Network. Acurast Processors are the infrastructure providers for Acurast's decentralized compute network. Processors provide the compute power of their phone and are used by developers to run their Deployments.

## Acurast Processor Core

_Only available for Android_

Provide compute with a dedicated phone, completely locked down and setup as a compute provider and join Acurast's decentralized compute network. Factory reset your Android phone, install the Acurast Processor to get started.

## Rewards

- **Deployment Execution**: Tokens (cACU on Canary, ACU on Mainnet) are rewarded when a processor's compute power is used by developers to run code. Developers that deploy to the Acurast Cloud provide a reward for the compute power used. When your Processor has been selected, you'll receive part of that reward.
- **Benchmark Rewards**: Providers receive rewards based on the [benchmarks](/acurast-processors/benchmarks) of their participating devices. On Canary, a total of 12'500 cACU are distributed per epoch (roughly every 1.5 hours). These rewards are split up to the different benchmarks pools and each phone competes with the others in the 4 benchmark pools. Higher specs usually lead to higher Benchmark Rewards.
- **Cloud Rebellion**: Join the [Cloud Rebellion](https://rebellion.acurast.com/) and harvest MIST ☁️ points. Become a Rebel and cloud-harvest MIST (points) by completing quests, onboarding Processors, and inviting others to join the Rebellion.
- ~~**Bootstrapping**: Earn 250 cACU each month in Bootstrapping Rewards. Run your Processor, connected to the internet, for a month and earn 250 cACU in bootstrapping rewards. You will earn a fraction of the full reward each hour.~~ (has been sundowned in favor of the Benchmark Rewards)

## Recommended Phones

Make sure to check out if your phone is on the list of recommended phones. In general, phones with higher specs will receive more rewards.
