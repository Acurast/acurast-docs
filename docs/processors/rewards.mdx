As a Compute Provider running Acurast Processors, you receive rewards for contributing your device's compute power to the network. The reward system is designed to incentivize reliable compute provision, high-quality hardware, and active participation in the Acurast ecosystem.

## Reward Types

### Base Benchmark Rewards (Compute Pool)

Providers receive rewards based on the [benchmarks](/acurast-processors/benchmarks) of their participating devices. These rewards are paid from Acurast's token inflation. On Canary and Mainnet, a total of 10% of Acurast's inflation are distributed per epoch (900 blocks / roughly every 1.5 hours). This equals to 856.164 tokens per epoch to distributed as Base Benchmark Rewards (Compute Pool) among all Compute Providers, independent of their participation in Staked Compute. These rewards are split up to the different benchmarks pools and each phone competes with the others in the 4 benchmark pools. Higher specs usually lead to higher Base Benchmark Rewards (Compute Pool).

### Staking Rewards (Staked Compute Pool)

Compute Providers who participate in [Staked Compute](/staked-compute/overview) earn additional rewards by committing their compute power and staking tokens. 70% of Acurast's inflation is distributed as Staking Rewards (Staked Compute Pool) every epoch, which is 5'993.15 tokens. Staking Rewards (Staked Compute Pool) are distributed based on hardware performance, stake size, and commitment duration.

### Deployment Execution Bonus

When a processor is detected executing a deployment during an epoch, it receives a bonus weight on the Benchmark Metrics that increases its scoring - and therefore its rewards - in both the Staked Compute Pool and the Compute Pool (Base Benchmarking Rewards) for that epoch. The deployment fees paid by developers will be burnt, which creates a deflationary effect.
