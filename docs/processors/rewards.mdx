As a Compute Provider running Acurast Processors, you receive rewards for contributing your device's compute power to the network. The reward system is designed to incentivize reliable compute provision, high-quality hardware, and active participation in the Acurast ecosystem.

## Reward Types

### Deployment Execution

Tokens (cACU on Canary, ACU on Mainnet) are rewarded when a processor's compute power is used by developers to run code. Developers that deploy to the Acurast Cloud provide a reward for the compute power used. When your Processor has been selected, you'll receive part of that reward.

### Benchmark Rewards

Providers receive rewards based on the [benchmarks](/acurast-processors/benchmarks) of their participating devices. On Canary, a total of 12'500 cACU are distributed per epoch (roughly every 1.5 hours). These rewards are split up to the different benchmarks pools and each phone competes with the others in the 4 benchmark pools. Higher specs usually lead to higher Benchmark Rewards.

### Cloud Rebellion

Join the [Cloud Rebellion](https://rebellion.acurast.com/) and harvest MIST points. Become a Rebel and cloud-harvest MIST (points) by completing quests, onboarding Processors, and inviting others to join the Rebellion.

### ~~Bootstrapping~~ (has been sundowned in favor of the Benchmark Rewards)

~~Receive 250 cACU each month in Bootstrapping Rewards. Run your Processor, connected to the internet, for a month and receive 250 cACU in bootstrapping rewards. You will receive a fraction of the full reward each hour.~~
