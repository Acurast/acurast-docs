Join Acurast's decentralized compute network and start receiving rewards by providing compute power with your smartphone. This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started as a Compute Provider.

## What is a Compute Provider?

Compute Providers are people who run the Acurast Processor App to provide infrastructure for Acurast's decentralized compute network. As a Compute Provider, you provide the compute power of your phone to developers who run their applications (called Deployments) on the Acurast network. In return, you receive rewards in the form of tokens.

## What you need to become a Compute Provider

Getting started as a Compute Provider is simple. Here's what you need:

**One or more Compatible Smartphones**
- **Android**: Android 12 or newer (non-rooted, locked bootloader)
- **iOS**: iPhone 6S or newer (iOS 15+)
- Higher specs (CPU, RAM, Storage) will potentially result in higher rewards
- Check the [Recommended Phones list ↗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZvzmMVey4CM2tuif_zJfWiIxH1qkgA-l7BNJMw4vh54/edit#gid=1844886586) for optimal reward potential

**Internet Connection**
- Stable Wi-Fi or mobile data connection
- Reliable connectivity ensures consistent uptime and maximum rewards

**Power Source**
- Keep your device charged or connected to power
- Continuous operation maximizes your rewards

**Acurast Wallet**
- Created automatically when you install the Acurast Processor app
- Or import an existing wallet if you already have one

That's it! No technical expertise required - the Acurast Processor app handles everything else.

## Recommended Phones

Make sure to check out if your phone is on the list of recommended phones. In general, phones with higher specs will receive more rewards.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Check Device Compatibility

Before getting started, make sure your device meets the requirements:

**Android Requirements:**
- Android 12 or newer
- Device must not be rooted
- Bootloader must be locked

**iOS Requirements:**
- iPhone 6S or newer
- iOS 15 or newer

### Step 2: Get an Acurast Compatible Wallet

Before setting up your Processor, you'll need a wallet to receive your rewards.

**Recommended Wallets:**
- **[MetaMask ↗](https://metamask.io/)** - Popular multi-chain wallet
- **[Talisman ↗](https://talisman.xyz/)** - Full-featured Substrate wallet
- **[SubWallet ↗](https://www.subwallet.app/)** - Multi-chain Substrate wallet

For more supported wallets and detailed wallet setup guides, see our [Wallet Documentation](/wallets/wallet-overview).

**Quick Setup (Talisman):**

1. Install the [Talisman browser extension ↗](https://talisman.xyz/)
2. Click "New Wallet" and create a strong password
3. Write down your recovery phrase and store it safely (never share this!)
4. Add Acurast network: Click the network dropdown → Search for "Acurast" → Enable it

### Step 3: Choose Your Processor Type

Acurast offers two types of Processors:

  <div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden'}}>
    <iframe
      style={{position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%'}}

      allowFullScreen>
    </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

**Acurast Processor Core** (Android only)
- Dedicated device setup for maximum performance
- Requires factory reset of your Android phone
- Only the Acurast Processor app will run on this phone (everything else is completely locked down)
- Best for serious compute providers
- [Setup via Acurast Hub ↗](https://hub.acurast.com/)

**Acurast Processor Lite** (Android & iOS)
- Runs on your everyday phone in edge-times (e.g. while you sleep and charge)
- No factory reset required
- Easy to get started
- [Download for Android ↗](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acurast.attested.executor.sbs.canary)
- [Download for iOS ↗](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acurast-processor/id6517361921)

### Step 4: Install and Setup

**For Processor Core:**

1. Factory reset your Android phone
2. Visit [Acurast Hub ↗](https://hub.acurast.com/) and connect with your wallet
3. Follow the detailed setup instructions for dedicated processors
4. Lock down the device as a dedicated compute provider

  <div style={{position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden'}}>
    <iframe

**For Processor Lite:**

1. Download the app from [Google Play ↗](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acurast.attested.executor.sbs.canary) or [Apple App Store ↗](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/acurast-processor/id6517361921)
2. Open the app and give the required permissions
3. Visit [Acurast Hub ↗](https://hub.acurast.com/), connect your wallet and use 'Onboard with hub'. Alternatively tap "Get Started" and a wallet will be created for you on the app.

### Step 5: Start Receiving Rewards

Once your Processor is set up and running, you'll automatically start receiving rewards:

**Deployment Execution Rewards**
- Receive tokens (cACU on Canary, ACU on Mainnet) when developers use your compute power
- Rewards are distributed when your Processor successfully executes code deployments
- The more deployments your Processors execute, the more you receive
- Developers set the amount they are willing to give as reward

**Benchmark Rewards**
- Receive based on your device's [benchmark performance](/acurast-processors/benchmarks)
- 12,500 cACU distributed per epoch (~1.5 hours) on Canary
- Rewards split across 4 benchmark pools (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- Higher-spec devices typically receive more

**Cloud Rebellion Points**
- Join the [Cloud Rebellion ↗](https://rebellion.acurast.com/) to receive MIST points
- Complete quests and onboard more Compute Providers
- Invite others to join and receive additional rewards

## Best Practices

To maximize your rewards and ensure smooth operation:

- **Keep your device connected to the internet** - Your Processor needs stable internet to receive and execute deployments

- **Ensure adequate power** - Keep your device charged or connected to power

- **Use recommended devices** - Higher-spec phones from the recommended list will receive more benchmark rewards

- **Run multiple processors** - Scale your compute provision by running [multiple devices](/acurast-processors/multiple-processors)

- **Monitor performance** - Check your benchmark scores and uptime regularly
