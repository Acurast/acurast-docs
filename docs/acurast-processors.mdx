Acurast Processors are the infrastructure providers for Acurast's decentralized serverless cloud.

Processors offer their computation of Android mobile devices to consumers. They process Acurast Jobs, request from consumers to get access to computation, running their specifications for e.g. accessing a public API. Processors will provide the output of the Acurast Job and a Proof of Execution on the specified destination by the developer e.g. Astar on Polkadot.
