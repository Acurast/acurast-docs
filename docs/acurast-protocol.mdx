Acurast leverages a Substrate Runtime consisting of multiple Substrate Pallets for the Acurast Substrate chain.

The Acurast protocol follows a permissionless philosophy and is optimized for the off-chain computation use case. By separating the crucial off-chain computation tasks from other dApps, Acurast is capable of mitigating known problematic situations related to network congestion. Scalability through purpose built native components helps Acurast achieve a much-needed level of service in the Web3 space.

Acurast will participate in the Kusama and Polkadot Parachain auctions for a Parachain slot, gaining access to Polkadot’s and Kusama’s security and the ability to communicate with other Parachains through the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM).

### Features

The main capabilities of the Acurast protocol are:

- Acurast Execution Verification Engine
- Interoperability through XCM and IBC
- Proof of Stake Consensus
- Acurast Marketplace
- Acurast Marketplace Reputation System
- Acurast Token Staking with Marketplace Fees as rewards
