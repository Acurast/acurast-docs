# FAQ

## Overall

### What is Acurast

Acurast is redefining compute by utilizing billions of smartphones – no data centers required. This verifiable, scalable, and confidential compute network enables users to run secure applications on decentralized infrastructure at scale—without compromising speed or privacy.

Acurast has already onboarded 104,000+ compute units worldwide on its incentivized testnet making it the most decentralized verifiable compute network available today. This impressive amount of compute already powers mission critical workloads with high-security and AI requirements.

This isn’t just another DePIN protocol — it’s a game-changer that’s redefining how the world computes.

### How can you provide compute with your phone on Acurast?

Get started as a [Processor](/acurast-processors) on Acurast and provide compute to earn rewards, either with Lite or Core:

#### **Acurast Processor Lite**

Lite is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it’s feasible for you. [How to onboard ↗](https://youtu.be/2Pxw2u0pZ_E?si=jHPCk82QI5I7rOKA)

Install the Acurast Processor Lite application on Android or iOS to get started.

[**Google Play ↗**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acurast.attested.executor.sbs.canary)  
[**Apple App Store ↗**](https://apps.apple.com/kh/app/acurast-processor/id6517361921)

#### **Acurast Processor Core**

Core is meant for dedicated phones with the only purpose of providing compute to Acurast, completely locked down. [How to onboard ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpBRUnmiPY)

**[Acurast Hub ↗](https://hub.acurast.com/)**

### Why is Acurast Using Mobile Phones?

When it comes to compute, phones are powerful and underestimated. These devices stand their ground in comparison with the server hardware of data centers. Still, they are more affordable in terms of acquisition cost and especially in terms of running cost due to their lower energy consumption. With your contribution, you can make them the perfect contender to disrupt the entire Compute industry.

### What are the use-case of Acurast?

Acurast enables decentralized, confidential, and scalable compute for various applications, including secure AI execution, decentralized bandwidth VPN services, automated on-chain trading strategies, and high-performance distributed computing for cost-efficient clusters, resilient website hosting, scalable zkProof generation and others.

### What wallets can I use on Acurast?

You can use any Polkadot-supported wallet. Wallets like MetaMask are also compatible.

### What is the difference between MIST, cACU & ACU?

- MIST are points, not tokens, used to incentivize rebels via the Cloud Rebellion.
- cACU is the canarynet (incentivized testnet) token of Acurast.
- ACU is the native token of the Acurast Network.

### How can I fund my wallet?

You can use the [Acurast Faucet ↗](https://faucet.acurast.com/) to claim cACU tokens. On the Acurast Hub or in the Processor Lite app click on "Fund Account", this prefills your address. To request funds, select "Get tokens" and complete the captcha.

### Why is my balance decreasing?

The Acurast network requires transaction fees whenever your Processor interacts with the chain. However, this is usually negligible, sometimes around (0.01 cACU).

### What is the difference between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

Acurast Processor Core is meant for dedicated phones, completely locked down, and intended only to provide compute to Acurast.

Whereas Lite is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it’s feasible for you.

If you have a phone that you don’t need any more for anything else, go with Core.

### What Android and iOS version are required?

The Android version required is Android 12 or higher, while the iPhone must be a 6s or later.

### Is there a difference in rewards between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

The bootstrapping reward, is the same on both versions, as long as your phone is connected to the internet, and the Processor application app is running, you’ll get a share of the rewards.

The difference comes into play for developer rewards. Developers can decide if they want to deploy on Core and Lite devices, or only on Core devices. Developers will want to utilize the first option for shorter deployments or by utilizing features of Lite e.g., a lot of different device locations and the second option for longer running deployments.

### I’m already running other Processors. Can I manage them all with one account?

Yes, most likely, you’ve connected a wallet to the Acurast Hub; follow these steps:

- Go to the Acurast Hub and select “Add New Device” to create a new QR code
- Install Acurast Processor Lite from Google Play or the Apple App Store on the phone
- Open Lite and select “Connect to Hub”
- Scan the QR code
- Complete the setup process, Lite is now connected to the Hub

### How can I tell how many heartbeats a processor has had?

The device heartbeats every 30 minutes. Scanning the blockchain allows you to look for all heartbeats, but that would take some time. To track the recent performance of your Processors, you can use the [Acurast Monitoring Bot](https://t.me/AcurastBot) on Telegram.

### Do I need to factory reset my phone?

You only need to factory reset your phone if you are onboarding a Core device, you need to factory reset it. However, for Processor Lite, you can use your everyday device without factory resetting it.

## Lite

### How do I install Acurast Processor Lite?

Acurast Lite can be installed within minutes. Watch the onboarding video here.
The Acurast Processor Lite application can run on Android or iOS. Simply install the app and follow the instructions.

[**Google Play ↗**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acurast.attested.executor.sbs.canary)  
[**Apple App Store ↗**](https://apps.apple.com/kh/app/acurast-processor/id6517361921)

### Android

#### Why do I need to setup an “Android Work” profile?

The Acurast Processor Lite leverages the advantages of the Android operating system by using the “Work” profile, a second profile completely independent from your private profile. By keeping your private profile separate from the one that provides compute, you’ll get the best security and have no impact on your privacy.

#### Who manages the “Android Work” profile?

You do. You’re in complete control. Your device is connected to the decentralized Acurast protocol (Acurast Canary) and controlled by you. In no way do any individuals have access to your phone to install other applications in that Work profile or make changes to it.

#### How do I uninstall Acurast Processor Lite?

Because Lite uses the Android work profile, you’ll have to remove it completely to uninstall the app from your device.

If you have set up Lite with “Get Started” without a connection to your Acurast Hub, make sure that you backup your secret before removing the app; otherwise, you will lose access to your earned cACU.

Uninstalling Processor Lite:

1. Open the "Settings" with the cog on the top right on the Acurast Processor application (make sure you can see the compute status)
1. Click "Uninstall" and "Continue"
1. The app in the work profile has been removed, you can now uninstall the app from your private profile

### iOS

## Core

### How do I install Acurast Processor Core?

- Factory reset the phone
- Head over to the Acurast Hub and connect your wallet
- Claim some cACU from the faucet with “Fund Account”
- Select “Add New Device” and sign the message with your wallet
- Take your phone and tap five to eight times on the start screen; the QR scanner should open
- Scan the QR code from the Hub
- Complete the setup process
- That’s it. You’re providing compute now; keep the device powered up and connected to the internet

### How to add Acurast Processor Core with NFC?

A short video by a community member onboard a device with a broken screen and an NFC.

## Acurast Hub

### The "Add New Device" QR code is not showing?

When this happens, you can do two things:

- Disconnect and connect your wallet to the Hub.
- Use another browser.
