# FAQ

### Why Phones?

When it comes to compute, phones are powerful and underestimated. These devices stand their ground in comparison to server hardware of data centers but are more affordable in acquisition cost and especially in running cost due to the lower energy consumption. With your contribution, making them the perfect contender to disrupt the entire Cloud industry.

### What is the difference between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

Acurast Processor Core is meant for dedicated phones with the only purpose of providing compute to Acurast, completely locked down.

Whereas Lite is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it’s feasible for you.

If you have a phone that you don’t need any more for anything else, go with Core.

### Is there a difference in rewards from Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

- The boostrapping reward, is the same on both versions, as long as your phone is connected to the internet, and the Processor application app is running, you’ll get a share of the rewards.
- The difference comes into play for developer rewards. Developers can decide if they want to deploy on Core and Lite devices, or only on Core devices. Developers will want to utilize the first option for shorter deployments or by utilizing features of Lite e.g., a lot of different device locations and the second option for longer running deployments.

## Lite

### What is Acurast Processor Lite?

The Acurast Processor Lite joins the decentralized Acurast Cloud, providing the compute power of your phone. Developers in turn can deploy their applications to that Cloud and ultimately your phone.

### Why do I need to setup an “Android Work” profile?

The Acurast Processor Lite leverages the advantages of the Android operating system by using the “Work” profile, a second profile that is completely independent from your private profile. By keeping your private profile separate from the one that provides compute, you’ll get the best security and have no impact on your privacy.

### Who manages the “Android Work” profile?

You do, you’re in complete control, your device is connected to the decentralized Acurast protocol (Acurast Canary) and controlled by you. In no shape or form any individuals have access to your phone to install other applications in that Work profile or make changes to it.

### I’m already running other Processors, can I manage them all with one account?

Yes, most likely you’ve connected a wallet to the Acurast Hub, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Acurast Hub and select “Add New Device” to create a new QR code
1. Install Acurast Processor Lite from the Google Play or the Apple App store on the phone
1. Open Lite and select “Connect to Hub”
1. Scan the QR code
1. Complete the setup process, Lite is now connected to the Hub

### Android

#### How do I uninstall Acurast Processor Lite?

Because Lite uses the Android work profile, you’ll have to first remove the profile to be able to uninstall the app from your device completely.

If you have setup Lite with “Get Started”, without a connection to your Acurast Hub, make sure that you backup your secret before removing the app, otherwise you will lose access to you earned cACU.
