# FAQ

## What is Acurast

Acurast is the largest decentralized compute network, leveraging smartphones to deliver secure, scalable, and confidential computing. By harnessing built-in TEEs and top-tier HSMs, smartphones surpass traditional servers in security, making them the most battle-tested and widely trusted devices for decentralized compute.

## Why Does Acurast Exist?

Acurast exists to decentralize computing by turning smartphones into secure, scalable compute nodes. Unlike traditional cloud models, Acurast leverages built-in TEEs and HSMs to provide a more secure, efficient, and accessible alternative—empowering developers, businesses, and users with confidential, permissionless computing.

## How can you get started on Acurast?

You can get started as a processor on Acurast either as a Core or Lite User:

_Acurast Processor Core_ is meant for dedicated phones with the only purpose of providing compute to Acurast, completely locked down. Watch the onboarding video here.

_Lite_ is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it’s feasible for you. Watch the onboarding video here.

Install the Acurast Processor Lite application on Android or iOS to get started.

Google Play ↗
Apple App Store ↗

## What is the required Phone Version?

The Android version required is Android 12 or higher, while the iPhone must be a 6s or later.

## What are the use-case of Acurast?

Acurast enables decentralized, confidential, and scalable compute for various applications, including secure AI execution for enterprise data, decentralized bandwidth for blockchain indexing and VPN services, automated on-chain trading strategies, and high-performance distributed computing for cost-efficient clusters, resilient website hosting, and scalable zkProof generation.

## What is the difference between MIST, cACU & ACU?

MIST are points, not tokens, used to incentivize rebels via the Cloud Rebellion.
cACU is the canarynet (Testnet) token of Acurast.
ACU is the native token of the Acurast Network.

## What Wallet can I use on Acurast?

You can use any Polkadot-supported wallet. Wallets like MetaMask are also compatible.

## How Can I Fund My Wallet?

You can use the Acurast Faucet to load cACU tokens into your account, which are identified by your address. To request funds, complete the captcha and click the button.

## Do I need to Factory reset my Phone?

If onboarding a Core device, you need to factory reset it. However, for the Lite, you can use your everyday device without factory resetting it.

## The QR code is not showing?

When this happens, you can do two things:

- Log out of the wallet and try again.
- Use another browser.

## Why is my balance going backwards?

The Network remove transaction fees whenever your Processor interacts with the chain. However, this is usually negligible, sometimes around (0.01 cACU).

## How to add Acurast core with NFC?

Here is a quick video by a community member onboard a device with a broken screen and an NFC.

## Why is Acurast Using Mobile Phones?

When it comes to compute, phones are powerful and underestimated. These devices stand their ground in comparison with the server hardware of data centres. Still, they are more affordable in terms of acquisition cost and especially in terms of running cost due to their lower energy consumption. With your contribution, you can make them the perfect contender to disrupt the entire Compute industry.

## What is the difference between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

Acurast Processor Core is meant for dedicated phones, completely locked down, and intended only to provide compute to Acurast.

Whereas Lite is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it’s feasible for you.

If you have a phone that you don’t need any more for anything else, go with Core.

## Is there a difference in rewards between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

The bootstrapping reward, is the same on both versions, as long as your phone is connected to the internet, and the Processor application app is running, you’ll get a share of the rewards.

The difference comes into play for developer rewards. Developers can decide if they want to deploy on Core and Lite devices, or only on Core devices. Developers will want to utilize the first option for shorter deployments or by utilizing features of Lite e.g., a lot of different device locations and the second option for longer running deployments.

## Why do I need to setup an “Android Work” profile?

The Acurast Processor Lite leverages the advantages of the Android operating system by using the “Work” profile, a second profile completely independent from your private profile. By keeping your private profile separate from the one that provides compute, you’ll get the best security and have no impact on your privacy.

## I’m already running other Processors. Can I manage them all with one account?

Yes, most likely, you’ve connected a wallet to the Acurast Hub; follow these steps:

- Go to the Acurast Hub and select “Add New Device” to create a new QR code
- Install Acurast Processor Lite from Google Play or the Apple App Store on the phone
- Open Lite and select “Connect to Console”
- Scan the QR code
- Complete the setup process, Lite is now connected to the Console

## Who manages the “Android Work” profile?

You do. You’re in complete control. Your device is connected to the decentralized Acurast protocol (Acurast Canary) and controlled by you. In no way do any individuals have access to your phone to install other applications in that Work profile or make changes to it.

## How do I install Acurast Processor Lite?

Acurast Lite can be installed within minutes. Watch the onboarding video here.
The Acurast Processor Lite application can run on Android or iOS. Simply install the app and follow the instructions.

Google Play ↗
Apple App Store ↗

## How do I uninstall Acurast Processor Lite?

Because Lite uses the Android work profile, you’ll have to remove it completely to uninstall the app from your device.

If you have set up Lite with “Get Started” without a connection to your Acurast Hub, make sure that you backup your secret before removing the app; otherwise, you will lose access to your earned cACU.

Uninstall the Lite app

## How do I install Acurast Processor Core?

- Get one of the recommended Android phones
- Factory reset the phone
- Head over to the Acurast Hub and connect your wallet
- Claim some cACU from the faucet with “Fund Account”
- Select “Add New Device” and sign the message with your wallet
- Take your phone and tap five to eight times on the start screen; the QR scanner should open
- Scan the QR code from the Console
- Complete the setup process
- That’s it. You’re providing compute now; keep the device powered up and connected to the internet

## How can I tell how many heartbeats a processor has had?

Usually, the device heartbeats every 30 minutes. Scanning the blockchain allows you to look for all heartbeats, but that would take some time. We don't have a service that tracks this for you. To track the recent performance of your processors, you can use the [Acurast Monitoring Bot](https://t.me/AcurastBot) on Telegram.
