# FAQ

## Overall

### What is Acurast

Acurast is redefining compute by utilizing billions of smartphones – no data centers required. This verifiable, scalable, and confidential compute network enables users to run secure applications on decentralized infrastructure at scale—without compromising speed or privacy.

Acurast has already onboarded 141,428+ compute units worldwide on its incentivized testnet making it the most decentralized verifiable compute network available today. This impressive amount of compute already powers mission critical workloads with high-security and AI requirements.

This isn’t just another DePIN protocol — it’s a game-changer that’s redefining how the world computes.

### How can you provide compute with your phone on Acurast?

Get started as a [Processor](/acurast-processors) on Acurast and provide compute to receive rewards, either with Lite or Core:

#### **Acurast Processor Lite**

Lite is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it’s feasible for you. [How to onboard ↗](https://youtu.be/2Pxw2u0pZ_E?si=jHPCk82QI5I7rOKA)

Install the Acurast Processor Lite application on Android or iOS to get started.

[**Google Play ↗**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.acurast.attested.executor.sbs.canary)  
[**Apple App Store ↗**](https://apps.apple.com/kh/app/acurast-processor/id6517361921)

#### **Acurast Processor Core**

Core is meant for dedicated phones with the only purpose of providing compute to Acurast, completely locked down. [How to onboard ↗](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLpBRUnmiPY)

**[Acurast Hub ↗](https://hub.acurast.com/)**

### Why is Acurast Using Mobile Phones?

When it comes to compute, phones are powerful and underestimated. These devices stand their ground in comparison with the server hardware of data centers. Still, they are more affordable in terms of acquisition cost and especially in terms of running cost due to their lower energy consumption. With your contribution, you can make them the perfect contender to disrupt the entire Compute industry.

### What are the use-case of Acurast?

Acurast enables decentralized, confidential, and scalable compute for various applications, including secure AI execution, decentralized bandwidth VPN services, automated on-chain trading strategies, and high-performance distributed computing for cost-efficient clusters, resilient website hosting, scalable zkProof generation and others.

### What wallets can I use on Acurast?

You can use any Polkadot-supported wallet. Wallets like MetaMask are also compatible.

**[See the full list of supported wallets ↗](/wallets/wallet-overview)**

### What is the difference between MIST, cACU & ACU?

- MIST are points, not tokens, used to incentivize rebels via the Cloud Rebellion.
- cACU is the Acurast Canary (incentivized testnet) token.
- ACU is the native token of the Acurast Mainnet.

### How can I fund my wallet?

You can use the [Acurast Faucet ↗](https://faucet.acurast.com/) to claim cACU tokens. On the Acurast Hub or in the Processor Lite app click on "Fund Account", this prefills your address. To request funds, select "Get tokens" and complete the captcha.

### Why is my balance decreasing sometimes?

Your balance may decrease slightly due to transaction fees when your Processor interacts with the Acurast network. Whenever the Processor reports to the chain (heartbeats, deployment acknowledgements, execution reports), minimal gas fees have to be paid, which can result in a decreasing balance. These fees are typically minimal, usually around 0.01 cACU per transaction.

### When is the TGE happening?

Originally planned for Q3 2025, the TGE was announced for November 17, 2025.

**[Read the full announcement ↗](https://acurast.com/blog/announcements/the-acurast-association-announces-launch-date-for-token-generation-event-tge-and-looks-ahead-to-next-steps/)**

### What is the cACU to ACU conversion mechanism?

#### How it works

1. User initiates conversion on Acurast Canary
2. cACU are burned on Canary
3. ACU is assigned to the account on Mainnet with a 1 to 1 ratio.
   e.g., 1000 cACU = 1000 ACU
4. On Mainnet the lock can be updated once between 3 to 48 cycles:  
   4.1. Default: Unlocked after 48x cycles at 28 days (3.7 years) = 1 to 1 ratio  
   4.2. Minimum: Unlocked after 3x cycles (2.8 months) = 6.5% ACU  
   4.3. Example: Unlocked after 24x cycles (1.75 years) = 50% ACU

#### Features

- The Conversion window is 90 days from its Activation afterwards no Conversion can be done.
- Converted and locked ACU can be Staked in Staked Compute Pool from Day 1 of Mainnet.
  ⟶ Staking Rewards are transferable (not locked) and claimable every epoch (1.5h)
- Converted and locked ACU can be used to participate in on-chain Governance
- If you continue to provide compute, you'll receive ACU rewards, that are transferable, from the Compute Pool.

### Is there an Airdrop?

The Acurast Association has announced the Cloud Rebellion Airdrop with 10,000,000 ACU tokens to be distributed based on MIST☁️ collected across all seasons (24 months linear vesting).

## Acurast Processor

### What is the difference between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

Acurast Processor Core is meant for dedicated phones, completely locked down, and intended only to provide compute to Acurast.

Whereas Lite is more flexible, can be installed on your everyday phone and activated to provide compute when it's feasible for you.

If you have a phone that you don't need any more for anything else, go with Core.

**[Learn more about Acurast Processors ↗](/acurast-processors)**

### What Android and iOS version are required?

The Android version required is Android 12 or higher, while the iPhone must be a 6s or later.

**[Check the list of recommended phones ↗](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZvzmMVey4CM2tuif_zJfWiIxH1qkgA-l7BNJMw4vh54/edit?gid=1844886586#gid=1844886586)**

### Is there a difference in rewards between Acurast Processor Core and Lite?

As long as your phone is connected to the internet, and the Processor application app is running, you get a reward.

The difference comes into play for developer rewards. Developers can decide if they want to deploy on Core and Lite devices, or only on Core devices. Developers will want to utilize the first option for shorter deployments or by utilizing features of Lite e.g., a lot of different device locations and the second option for longer running deployments.

### I’m already running other Processors. Can I manage them all with one account?

Yes, most likely, you’ve connected a wallet to the Acurast Hub; follow these steps:

- Go to the Acurast Hub and select “Add New Device” to create a new QR code
- Install Acurast Processor Lite from Google Play or the Apple App Store on the phone
- Open Lite and select “Connect to Hub”
- Scan the QR code
- Complete the setup process, Lite is now connected to the Hub

### How can I tell how many heartbeats a processor has had?

The device heartbeats every 30 minutes. Scanning the blockchain allows you to look for all heartbeats, but that would take some time. To track the recent performance of your Processors, you can use the [Acurast Monitoring Bot](https://t.me/AcurastBot) on Telegram.

### Do I still get rewards if my Processor is missing heartbeats?

**[Benchmark rewards](/processors/rewards)** are distributed if one of 3 heartbeats of an epoch (roughly 90 minutes) was received on chain. This means your device can miss some heartbeats without missing out on rewards.

### Do I need to factory reset my phone?

You only need to factory reset your phone if you are onboarding a Core device. However, for Processor Lite, you can use your everyday device without factory resetting it.

## Lite

### How do I install Acurast Processor Lite?

Acurast Lite can be installed within minutes. The Acurast Processor Lite application can run on Android or iOS.

**[Follow the step-by-step installation guide ↗](/processors/become-compute-provider#for-processor-lite)**

### Android: Why do I need to setup an "Android Work" profile?

Android Work profiles are a built-in feature of Android, typically used by organizations to separate work apps and data from personal apps on the same device. This creates a secure, isolated container managed by an enterprise or organization.

The Acurast Processor Lite leverages this proven Android feature to create a secure, isolated environment for providing compute. The Work profile acts as a second profile completely independent from your private profile. By keeping your private profile separate from the one that provides compute, you'll get the best security and have no impact on your privacy.

### Android: Who manages the "Android work" profile?

You do. You're in complete control. Your device is connected to the decentralized Acurast protocol (Acurast Canary) and controlled by you. In no way do any individuals have access to your phone to install other applications in that work profile or make changes to it.

**Important Note:** During setup, you may see standard Android messages like "Your device isn't private" or "Your IT admin may see your data...". These are default warnings that appear whenever a work profile is created. In the case of Acurast, you remain in complete control - these are simply standard messages Android displays for all work profile setups.

### Android: How do I uninstall Acurast Processor Lite?

Because Lite uses the Android work profile, you’ll have to remove it completely to uninstall the app from your device.

If you have set up Lite with "Get Started" without a connection to your Acurast Hub, make sure that you backup your secret before removing the app; otherwise, you will lose access to your cACU.

Uninstalling Processor Lite:

1. Open the "Settings" with the cog on the top right on the Acurast Processor application (make sure you can see the compute status)
1. Click "Uninstall" and "Continue"
1. The Processor app in the work profile has been removed, you can now uninstall the lite app from your private profile and the work profile should be removed too (might be subject to Android version).

## Core

### How do I install Acurast Processor Core?

Acurast Processor Core is designed for dedicated Android phones. Follow the detailed installation instructions to get started.

**[Follow the step-by-step installation guide ↗](/processors/become-compute-provider#for-processor-core)**
