The Acurast Marketplace plays a significant role in the definition, agreement and enforcement of the value exchange taking place between the Acurast Data Transmitters (in short transmitter) and the Data Consumers (in short “consumer”).

The marketplace is where the matching engine brings together the advertised resources of the transmitters with the advertised requirements of the consumers (aka developer). Various price finding mechanisms such as auctions and advertisements are provided natively in the marketplace as implementation of the philosophy of Accessibility followed by the Acurast platform.

Every agreement between transmitter and consumer are specified in an entity called Acurast Job (in short “job”). The job specifies a set of instructions that is run in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) of the transmitter, its scheduling parameters, the destination of where the resulting data is expected and the commercial terms, the pricing.

There are two flows central to the value exchange in Acurast:

- The data flow
- The monetary flow

## Data Flow

What consumers do when they specify a job is express their need for verifiable data which can be consumed on-chain. This data can be the result of an observation of a public data point (aka API), an off-chain computation, the privacy preserving observation of proprietary data (aka permissioned data) or a combination of all these use cases.

On a high level this can be compared to when in the web2 world a developer expresses their need for computation on a cloud provider like e.g., Amazon Web Services.

This need is covered by the transmitter. The transmitter is offering the service at the cost of a monetary compensation.

## Monetary Flow

The consumer defines the budget for the execution made by the transmitter. It is up to the consumer, to define the currency, allowing them to use besides the native Acurast token also a stabelcoin such as USDt. This allows for clear budgeting on the execution of jobs for both the consumer and the transmitter.

The transmitter will receive the payment automatically upon successful execution of the jobs, defined by the consumer.

The Acurast protocol is built that whenever the service is consumed and paid for, a 30% tax (aka marketplace fee) is applied on the transaction.

This example shows a data consumer paying $100 for the service and how it is split up between the transmitter offering the service and the Acurast Token Stakers.

## Marketplace Fee Sharing

To have a sustainable protocol Acurast requires a form of value capture. This is required to incentivize the Acurast stake holders, ensures future development and maintenance as well as payment to the protocol node operators. In short, it’s the flywheel of the protocol. Unlike other protocols where tokens have just a “symbolical value” the Acurast token captures said value by combining the battle tested app store business model seen on Apple’s Appstore and Google’s Playstore[ref] with the business model of staking incentives. A 30% tax is applied on every exchange of value on the Acurast Marketplace, this tax is used to buy back Acurast Tokens from the market and distribute them among long-term Acurast Token Stakers.

Besides providing constant buy-support this mechanism redistributes the token such that sell-pressure is also minimized by putting the token in the hands of long-term holders. As mentioned, data consumers can pay the execution of their Acurast Jobs in various currencies. But the Acurast Staker receives the native Acurast token, before distributing the rewards in e.g., a stablecoin it is exchanged on a Decentralized exchange to the native Acurast token.

This results essentially in a cycle where the Acurast tokens are constantly bought from the market with the stablecoins accumulated as a tax from the marketplace. Through this approach the consumer has a way to budget their costs and the staker receives a return in the desired token, the Acurast token.

The marketplace fee is decided by the Acurast token holders in a governance process and can be changed.
