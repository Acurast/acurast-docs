# Acurast Token (ACU)

## Chains and token contracts

The Acurast Token (ACU) is the native utility token of the Acurast network, powering the decentralized compute economy. Acurast is multichain in nature and the token is available on the Acurast mainnet as well as on various other blockchains and ecosystems. Deployed on its native chain, it can be bridged to Ethereum using the Acurast HyperDrive bridge and further from Ethereum to various EVM chains via LayerZero bridges.

## Overview
ACU serves multiple critical functions within the Acurast ecosystem:

* **Deployment Fees**: Submitted by developers using Acurast Compute
* **Network Fees**: Required for transaction fees on the Acurast network
* **Rewards**: Provides economic security through Staked Compute as well as Base Benchmark Rewards
* **Collator rewards**: Rewards for validators and block producers
* **Cross chain transfers**: Bridged instances of the ACU token, to be moved across various networks

## Token instances

### ACU on Acurast Mainnet

ACU is the native currency of the Acurast Mainnet, which is Substrate-based Polkadot parachain. ACU is used to pay for chain interactions and is the currency to submit for deployments and that is distributed for Staking Rewards, Base Benchmark Rewards and Collator Rewards.

### ACU on Ethereum

On Ethereum, ACU is available as an ERC20 token, deployed at [`0x216b3643ff8b7BB30d8A48E9F1BD550126202AdD`](https://etherscan.io/token/0x216b3643ff8b7BB30d8A48E9F1BD550126202AdD)

Native Acurast tokens from Acurast Mainnet can be bridged to Ethereum and back, using the bridge at [hub.acurast.com](https://hub.acurast.com).

### ACU on Binance Smart Chain (bridged)

On Binance Smart Chain, ACU is deployed as a LayerZero OFT at [`0x6EF2FFB38D64aFE18ce782DA280b300e358CFeAF`](https://bscscan.com/token/0x6EF2FFB38D64aFE18ce782DA280b300e358CFeAF)

ERC20 ACU from Ethereum can be bridged to BSC and back, using the LayerZero bridge via [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance/) or other LayerZero frontends.

### ACU on Base (bridged)

On Base, ACU is deployed as a LayerZero OFT at [`0xc5fEd7c8cCC75D8A72b601a66DffD7A489073F0b`](https://basescan.org/token/0xc5fEd7c8cCC75D8A72b601a66DffD7A489073F0b)

ERC20 ACU from Ethereum can be bridged to Base and back, using the LayerZero bridge via [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance/) or other LayerZero frontends.

### ACU on Peaq (bridged)

On Peaq, ACU is deployed as a LayerZero OFT at [`0x165bcb970836F83c15b22c3c1622279d97A20446`](https://peaq.subscan.io/account/0x165bcb970836F83c15b22c3c1622279d97A20446)

ERC20 ACU from Ethereum can be bridged to Peaq and back, using the LayerZero bridge via [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance/) or other LayerZero frontends.

## Bridging pathways and platforms

Bridging ACU from and to the native Acurast Mainnet, can be done from and to Ethereum, via the [Acurast HyperDrive](/integrations#level-2) bridge.

ACU from Ethereum can then be bridged via [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) to and from various EVM chains. Bridging is also possible between all target chains, eg. from BSC to Base, or from Peaq to BSC. ACU will be available on commonly used LayerZero bridging interfaces, like [stargate.finance](https://stargate.finance/).
