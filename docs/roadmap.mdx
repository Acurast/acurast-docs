Major milestones in the 2025 roadmap include:

- Genesis Mainnet Launch, TGE (Q3 2025).
- Governance Activation for Decentralized Community Involvement.
- Codename Cargo (Compute Containers) for modularized workloads, making serverless deployments even easier to deploy and scale.
- Codename Cray (Compute Clusters) cluster of hundreds of devices enabling high-performance compute tasks capable of running even the largest LLMs available. Effectively mitigating the vertical compute limitation arising from working with phones.
- Furthermore, the future roadmap includes:

- Codename Bazaar (Compute Economy), creating an active decentralized compute economy for developers to distribute entire software solutions seamlessly without limitations.
- Codename Rice (Compute Futures), innovating long-term decentralized compute economic strategies. Allowing compute providers to leverage their infrastructure and support their future scaling.

Acurast’s growth strategy in 2025 is about activating a network effect at scale, where more phones bring more compute, more compute brings more builders, and more builders bring more value into the ecosystem. It’s a positive-sum loop powered by real-world demand, seamless integrations, and decentralized ownership, creating a compute marketplace flywheel.

Here’s how Acurast is scaling fast—and sustainably:

### 1. Mainnet Launch → Permissionless, Global Access

With the **Genesis Mainnet and TGE launching in Q3 2025**, Acurast becomes fully open, decentralized, and permissionless. Anyone with a smartphone can start earning as a compute provider. Anyone with workloads, from solo builders to AI startups, can deploy confidential applications on a decentralized network backed by hundreds of thousands of real, verifiable phones.

Mainnet is Acurast’s on-ramp to true global accessibility, where compute is no longer gatekept by geography, capital, or centralized infrastructure.

### 2. Seamless Native Integrations with Major Web3 Ecosystems

We’re embedding Acurast directly into the world’s most active blockchain ecosystems, **Solana, Ethereum, Polkadot, and beyond**, so web3 developers can access decentralized, confidential compute as easily as calling a smart contract.

These native integrations mean:

- Developers can spin up secure compute from within their dApp flows
- Protocols gain censorship-resistant backends
- Ecosystems unlock AI, automation, and zero-knowledge tasks without centralized dependencies

This makes Acurast not just complementary, but critical infrastructure for Web3’s next phase.

### 3. Expanding Beyond Web3: Serving SMEs and Enterprises

While we’re crypto-native at our core, we’re **not limited to Web3**. We're actively supporting **SMEs and enterprise use cases** — especially around **confidential AI, confidential compute, and secure edge deployments:**

- Allowing enterprises to tap into AI without the fear of exposing business-critical and proprietary data by tapping into confidential AI compute
- Workloads requiring confidential compute without the complexity or cost of standing up traditional cloud infrastructure
- Enterprises in emerging markets lacking access to reliable data centers

Acurast offers these users **a confidential, on-demand, scalable, and cost-efficient alternative** to centralized compute.

### 4. Hyper-Onboarding of Smartphones at Global Scale

Our onboarding strategy is rooted in mutual value creation. Initiatives like the **Cloud Rebellion**, major partnerships, and region-specific programs are designed to scale us from 70,000 devices to over 1 million, converting dormant phones into high-value, secure nodes.

Each new phone adds network supply, but also unlocks new regions and new use cases, especially in areas where traditional compute is inaccessible.

### 5. Unlocking New Economic Layers

With milestones like:

- **Cargo** (modular compute containers)
- **Cray** (clustered high-performance compute)
- **Bazaar** (open compute marketplace)
- and **Rice** (long-term compute futures)

We’re not just scaling tech—we’re building an open compute economy, where compute is programmable, tradable, and ownable. Each upgrade compounds utility, revenue, and token demand.

### 6. Community-Driven Governance & Protocol Expansion

The Acurast community will shape protocol decisions post-mainnet through **on-chain governance** and a self-replenishing treasury. This turns users into stakeholders, and stakeholders into contributors.

**\*In short:** Acurast's 2025 growth strategy creates a flywheel:

**More devices → more demand → more utility → more contributors → more value.**

And at the center of that flywheel is a single insight: **you don’t need a data center to be part of the future of compute—just your phone.**

Now is the time to join.
