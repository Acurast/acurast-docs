## Post Mortem

### Date & Time

11.04.2025 at 2:30 GMT+2

### Engineer

Andreas Gassmann, Mike Godenzi

### Summary

The Acurast Canary chain stopped regularly producing new blocks for about 2 hours.

### Status

Resolved

### Root causes

The Acurast collators could not produce any new blocks because the Kusama relay chain nodes they were connected to were in a crash loop, exhibiting the behavior described in [this Github issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/4934).

The Kusama nodes were running on a version containing the bug detailed in the issue linked above. Restarting the nodes did not improve the situation.

After around 2 hours the Kusama relay nodes started to work properly again.

### Trigger

Kusama relay chain nodes used by the Acurast collators entered in a crash loop because of a bug described in [this Github issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/4934).

### Resolution

The relay chain nodes affected started to work again after around 2 hours. Afterwards they have been all updated to the latest version.

In addition, all Acurast collators node have been configured with additional relay chain nodes as fallback.

### Timeline

2:30: 
- block production halts

2:42: 
- initial triage of issue
- discovered Kusama relay chain nodes used by the Acurast collators entered in a crash loop
- restarting of Kusama relay chain nodes
- restarting of all acurast parachain nodes
- continues triage of issue after chain still did not recover

4:33:
- Kusama relay chain nodes started to work again

### Lesson learned

- Keep Kusama nodes up to date
- Have more additional backup nodes configured as the relay chain nodes for the Acurast Collators.
