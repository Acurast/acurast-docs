# Singularity

The **Singularity** module focuses on **AI**.

Acurast Processors leverage the **Trusted Execution Environment** of mobile devices that are already built in mind to perform learning tasks of language models. Through the decentralized nature of the Acurast network with computational resources being provided by individuals or enterprises that run Acurast Processor, AI learning can be done in a completely decentralized approach without having to rely on centralized cloud providers and unnecessarly expose the model and its output.

# Mesh

The **Mesh** module focuses on **IoT**.

As Acurast is leveraging the **Trusted Execution Environment** of mobile devices, secured access to Bluetooth modules is available natively that can be leveraged to securely and verifiably communicate with Bluetooth LE devices such as IoT sensors.
