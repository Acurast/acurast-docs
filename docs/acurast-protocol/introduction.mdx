Acurast leverages a Substrate Runtime consisting of multiple Substrate Pallets for the Acurast Protocol.

The Acurast protocol follows a permissionless philosophy and is optimized for providing access to a decentralized network of computation resources. By separating the crucial computation tasks from other dApps, Acurast is capable of mitigating known problematic situations related to network congestion. Scalability through purpose built native components helps Acurast achieve a much-needed level of service in the Web3 space.

Acurast has secured a Kusama Parachain slot for its incentivized testnet and will participate in a Polkadot Parachain auctions for a Parachain slot. Gaining access to Polkadot’s and Kusama’s security and the ability to communicate with other Parachains through the Cross-Consensus Message Format (XCM).

## Features

The main capabilities of the Acurast protocol are:

- Acurast Marketplace
  - Acurast Job Matching Engine
  - Acurast Marketplace Reputation System
  - Acurast Execution Verification Engine
- Proof of Stake Consensus
- Interoperability with [Hyperdrive](/acurast-protocol/modules/hyperdrive)
- Acurast Token Staking

## Modules

Through Acurast's modularity, four modules, focusing on different verticals are introduced. All of them leveraging Acurast's confidential computing layer and the Acurast Marketplace.

### Enterprise - Web2

Focused on the legacy **Web2** world, giving access to public or permissioned APIs and computation. Off-chain data and computation that is being brought on-chain in a verifiable way. Sometimes also referred as "Oracle".

**[Enterprise ↗](/acurast-protocol/modules/enterprise)**

### Hyperdrive - Web3

Seamless cross-chain communication between two **Web3** ecosystems, executing context completely trustlessly on another chain through Acurast's computational layer.

**[Hyperdrive ↗](/acurast-protocol/modules/hyperdrive)**

### Singularity - AI

Utilizing Aurast's decentralized confidential computing resources for **Artificial Intelligence** language model learning in a trustless contract where the data context is not exposed.

### Mesh - IoT

Leveraging the mobile device nature of the Acurast Processor with its built in Bluetooth modules for communication with **IoT** devices.

## Networks

### Kusama

Acurast has secured a Parachain slot on Kusama in Auction #76 and is scheduled to launch its incentivized testnet soon.

### Polkadot

Anticipated launch on Polkadot is Q1 of 2024.
