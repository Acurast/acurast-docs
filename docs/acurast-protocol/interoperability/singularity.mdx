# Singularity

The **Singularity** interoperability module focuses on **AI**.

Acurast Processors leverage the **Trusted Execution Environment** of mobile devices that are already built in mind to perform learning tasks of language models. Through the decentralized nature of the Acurast network with computational resources being provided by individuals or enterprises that run Acurast Processor, AI learning can be done in a completely decentralized approach without having to rely on centralized cloud providers and unnecessarly expose the model and its output.
