### Real Decentralized Compute Network - Powered by Phones

Acurast is redefining compute by utilizing billions of smartphones – no data centers required. This verifiable, scalable, and confidential compute network enables users to run secure applications on decentralized infrastructure at scale—without compromising speed or privacy.

Acurast has already onboarded 131,250+ compute units worldwide on its incentivized testnet making it the most decentralized verifiable compute network available today. This impressive amount of compute already powers mission critical workloads with high-security and AI requirements.

This isn’t just another DePIN protocol — it’s a game-changer that’s redefining how the world computes.

As global demand for computing power continues to skyrocket, control has gradually shifted into the hands of a few large, centralized providers. With AI’s rapid growth further accelerating the need for massive computing resources, the call for a truly decentralized, global-scale network—by the people, for the people—has never been stronger.

The only way to deliver on this vision is by rethinking decentralized compute from the ground up. Instead of relying on data centers or even servers, Acurast harnesses the world’s most abundant, powerful, and secure form of compute: smartphones.

### Decentralized by Design:

Over 131,250 phones as compute units stretch across the globe without relying on centralized data centers, united by a community of more than 75,000 “Cloud Rebels.” Active in over 140 countries, this network sets a new standard for true decentralization.

### Scalable by Design:

By tapping into the compute of billions of smartphones worldwide, it’s primed to reach an unprecedented scale. Backed by academic research benchmarking its performance against leading centralized providers, it’s built for the future of decentralized compute. Battle-tested: The Acurast protocol has processed more than 250 million transactions on Testnet, demonstrating its impressive scalability and resilience.

### Secure by Design:

Acurast safeguards over $200 million in digital assets across leading networks—such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, TON, Polkadot and others. The smartphone’s best-in-class Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) confirm that hardware is genuine rather than fake, while maintaining confidentiality without requiring trust in the device owner. This strong emphasis on verifiability and confidentiality delivers the robust security essential for mass adoption of decentralized compute.
