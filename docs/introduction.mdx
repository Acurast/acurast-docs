# Acurast Documentation

### The Universe in Web3 - Universal Interoperability

#### Interconnecting Web2, Web3, AI, IoT through one unified platform.

Universal interoperability, onboarding various distinct worlds on a single platform, the Acurast Universe.

Acurast is a permissionless, decentralized blockchain orchestrating and scheduling the participants’ intentions and executes these in a confidential computing context. This provides developers with a distributed, highly scalable arbitrary computation engine ready to be used for the most security sensitive tasks. Allowing projects and enterprises to securely interoperate regardless of the underlying technology.

## Architecture

### Consumers

Consumers or Developers are the ones that are in need of interoperability for their decentralized applications. Consumers can define in accessible Javascript code their requirements and get access to computational resources through the Acurast Marketplace by being matched with Processors.

**[Developers ↗](/developers/introduction)**

### Processors

Acurast Processors offer their computation to Consumers, fulfilling their interoperability requests and are in turn rewarded by the Consumers for executing and providing a verifiable output on the defined destination chain. At this stage Processors utilize dedicated Android mobile devices as the off-chain infrastructure and get onboarded within minutes.

**[Processors ↗](/acurast-processors/)**

### Marketplace

The Acurast Marketplace is where the demand from Consumers for interoperability requests meets the supply of computational ressources from Processors. Consumers reward one or more Processors for the successfull fulfillment of their request, through the Marketplace they are automatically matched based on the parameters defined by both sides.

## Interoperability Modules

Through Acurast modular interoperability, four modules, focusing on different verticals are introduced. All of them leveraging Acurast's confidential computing layer and the Acurast Marketplace.

### Enterprise - Web2

Focused on the legacy **Web2** world, giving access to public or permissioned APIs and computation. Off-chain data and computation that is being brought on-chain in a verfiable way. Sometimes also reffered as "Oracle".

**[Enterprise ↗](/acurast-protocol/interoperability/enterprise)**

### Hyperdrive - Web3

Seamless cross-chain communication between two **Web3** ecosystems, executing context completely trustlessly on another chain through Acurast's computational layer.

**[Hyperdrive ↗](/acurast-protocol/interoperability/hyperdrive)**

### Singularity - AI

Utilizing Aurast's decentralized confidential computing ressources for **Artificial Intelligence** language model learning in a trustless contract where the data context is not exposed.

**[Singularity ↗](/acurast-protocol/interoperability/singularity)**

### Mesh - IoT

Leveraging the mobile device nature of the Acurast Processor with its built in Bluetooth modules for communication with **IoT** devices.

**[Mesh ↗](/acurast-protocol/interoperability/mesh)**

## Supported Ecosystems & Integrations

As Acurast has interoperability at its core, it supports numerous ecosystems and multiple ways of extending support through integration in various environments such as EVM, WASM, Parachains and more.
