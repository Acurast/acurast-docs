### Real Decentralized Compute Network - Powered by Phones

#### Motivation

Centralized trust is ubiquitous in today’s interconnected world, from computational resources to data storage and its underlying infrastructure. The monopolization of cloud computing resembles a feudalistic system, causing a loss of privacy and data ownership.

Cloud Computing and the Internet in general face widely recognized challenges, such as:

1. the centralization of trust in auxiliary systems (e.g., centralized cloud providers),
2. the seamless and permissionless interoperability of fragmented ecosystems and
3. the effectiveness, verifiability, and confidentiality of the computation.

Acurast is a decentralized compute network that addresses all these shortcomings, following the call for a global-scale cloud founded on the principles of the open-source movement.
